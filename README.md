## The Backstory
I built a fully functional Chrome Extension called… wait for it… Web Memo. Super creative right! The idea is simple… I do a lot of “snacking” on the web, watch part of a podcast here, speed read a blog there. I also multi-task a lot, research new shoes to buy for walking to work in Seattle rains, plan for upcoming birthday party for my soon-to-be 6 year old, learn new magic tricks to entertain kids at her party, sharpen my AI chops, and so on. Now the challenge is content snacking + a number of mini projects means I sometimes forget where I last read that nice blog. There is also doing too much research rabbit hole. How do I make the right decision, quickly and sanely? Then there is, I like to revisit reading this later. Then… I don’t have time to go through 1.5 hours of this podcast, what are the key takeaways which matter to me the most.

Can one humble Chrome Extension solve all this? Drumroll… I think I have cracked the code. No pun intended! Capture memos as I browse the web. Each memo can be part of a website, a product description, a blog, or an entire podcast transcript. Categorize memos automatically into project tags like Shopping, Technology, Entertainment. Then chat with my projects to get the insights I need. Store all my memos locally. So no hosting and super fast responses. Use the LLM of my choice. And looks like we can tick all the boxes.
